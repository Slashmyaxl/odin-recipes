    <h1>Macaroni & Cheese</h1>
    <div><img src="https://minimalistbaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VEGAN-Garlic-Mac-n-Cheese-So-creamy-and-cheesy-youd-never-guess-it-was-dairy-free-dinner-vegan-recipe.jpg" alt="Mac & Cheese"></div>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dairy-free version of a classic comfort dish packs a punch of garlic flavor and goes well with the optional addition of mushrooms and/or broccoli. Inspired by <a href="https://www.minimalistbaker.com/garlic-mac-n-cheese" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minimalist Baker</a>, I've modified this into a dish I like to dub "World Famous," as a Portuguese friend of mine has made and served it to her loved ones overseas. Comforting, warming, and delicous.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 heads garlic, roasted</li>
        <li>10 oz. elbow macaroni noodles (8oz. if adding mushrooms/broccoli)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oil (grapeseed, sunflower, or olive)</li>
        <li>4 cloves raw garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups almond milk (unflavored, unsweetened)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup <a href="../recipes/cashewparm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cashew parmesan cheese</a></li>
        <li>1/3 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pankp bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast garlic at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes, then let cool.</li>
        <li>Cook macaroni in salted boiling water per package instructions and preferences (i.e. al dente vs. soft). Drain and cover.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-low heat, add oil. Once hot, add raw garlic. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, whisk into oil, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Slowly incorporate almond milk, adding 1/2 cup at a time, then whisking. Repeat until all milk is used. Cook for 2 minutes, stir frequently.</li>
        <li>Transfer contents of skillet to blender. Add roasted garlic, salt, peper, cashew parmesan cheese, and nutritional yeast. Blend until smooth and creamy. Taste and add seasonings to desired taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer contents of blender back to skillet. Cook and stir frequently for 2-3 minutes until sauce is thick.</li>
        <li>Fold in cooked pasta (and mushrooms/broccoli if using) until coated in sauce.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Top with panko bread crumbs and 1 Tbsp nutritional yeast.</li>
        <li>Broil in oven for 1-2 minutes until top is golden-brown, careful not to burn.</li>
        <li>Top with smoked paprika (optional), serve, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
