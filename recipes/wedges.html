        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A comforting appetizer for all to enjoy! One family member of mine has endearingly dubbed these "Perfect Potatoes," making me especially proud whenever I get the browning just right. All together tasty, healthy, and nutritious because I don't care what anyone says - potatoes are vegetables.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 russet potatoes</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Wash and dry potatoes, slice into halves three times if potatoes are large (you should end up with 8 wedges per potato). Depending on size of potatoes, you may want to slice so that each potato yields 6 wedges</li>
                <li>In large mixing bowl, add potato wedges, then olive oil. Mix/toss until all wedges are coated in oil.</li>
                <li>Add salt and pepper, then mix/toss again. Add cumin, then mix/toss until seasoning appears evenly distributed accross potato wedges.</li>
                <li>Place wedges on baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Cook at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes, until underside of wedges are golden-brown. Flip each wedge onto opposite side.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking on opposite sides for additional 18-22 minutes, until potato wedges are roughly golden-brown all around.</li>
            </ol>
